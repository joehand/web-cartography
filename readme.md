# Web Cartography Syllabus

Hack Oregon - Web Cartography Summer 2017

## Course Description

With the proliferation of location data and the power it has to influence everything from marketing to hardware, the need for quality map-based interfaces has never been higher. Use LeafletJS, the most popular JavaScript mapping library, to create elegant interfaces that utilize a wealth of geodata to create powerful tools and visualizations.

This course will give you a foundation of understanding and using spatial data on the web. We will start with fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), as applicable to the web. Then we will cover geodata formats and command line processing tools. Finally, we will build maps using common open source mapping tools such as, leaflet, mapbox-gl, and d3.

### Who should take this course?

The ideal student for this course loves translating data into useful applications. You should also have a passion for maps and the kind of information they can articulate. Successful students will understand the unique characteristics of maps. By the end of the course, students will be able to make compelling maps with some interactivity.

### How do I know I'm ready?

You should be confident with JavaScript and have an understanding of how the DOM works. You should be willing to jump into the command line for to learn data processing tools. Students do not need any prior knowledge of GIS.

## Course Objectives

* Demonstrate understanding of GIS fundamentals applied to web maps.
* Be able to critically examine maps produced by others, with a focus on maps visualizing data.
* Practice finding, processing, and visualizing spatial data.
* Experiment with various open source mapping libraries and be able to evaluate when each can be used effectively.
* Identify personal projects where maps would be beneficial and improve communication.

## Schedule

**(rough outline)**

* Mondays will focus on GIS concepts and readings
* Wednesday will focus on OSS libraries and building maps

## Getting Help

We will have some class time each week for pairing on projects or getting help. We can help each other in Slack. Please see information about using Slack before asking.

A lot of programming and making maps is about asking questions, so please ask! But the other side of that is that a lot of programming is learning how to answer questions. (The experience of programming offline is a testament to that - I still have trouble working offline sometimes, without the ability to look up syntax or common problems.)

Guidelines for getting help:

* Asking me: Open Slack hours 1-2 hrs/week (time TBD)
* Asking other students:
  * 10 min rule (see *using slack*)
  * Try rubber ducking (I have a squishy owl I ask)

### Using Slack

For everyone to get the most out of the class, I am proposing a few "rules" for asking questions on our Slack channel.

* *10 min rule*: Spend ~10 minutes trying to answer your own question. Search the internet, read documentation, look for solutions in other code. The idea is that before you take 10 minutes of someone else's time, you should spend 10 minutes of your own time.
* *Rubber duck first*: ask the question to a nice inanimate object or the Slack bot.

## About Joe

This is the first Hack Oregon class I have taught. I have a background in development, project management, data viz, and research.

Things I've worked on recently:

* Dat project (current): we are building open source data sharing tools for researchers, governments, and you.
* Santa Fe Institute: we helped create mapping tools for communities in slums/informal settlements to collect census-like data. Also did research with census data (and made maps!).
* Periscopic: a local data visualization company.

### Contact

* Open Slack office hours 1-2 hrs/week (time TBD)
* DM on Slack
* Email
